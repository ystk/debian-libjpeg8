IJG JPEG for Debian
===================

The following patch has been applied to the headers files:

--- jconfig.h: Remove unused symbol HAVE_STDDEF_H, HAVE_STDLIB_H and
HAVE_LOCALE_H since they are not used by the installed headers files and cause
problem with autoconf.

This can theoretically cause problems if your software relies on theses symbols
being defined by this header. If it ever happens, please define them manually.

Note: this is not Debian-specific, others distributions apply similar patches.

Thanks for using Debian!
